## Azure Functions Lab

In this part of the lab, you will create an Azure function that will be used to programmatically send data back to the Raspberry Pi. The Azure function that you will create will be triggered by events that arrive at the IoT Hub. If the status of the Raspberry Pi is normal and the newly reported temperature goes above the set threshold, the status of Sense HAT will be set to high. If the status is at high and the temperature goes below the threshold, the status will be reset to normal. These state changes will be sent back to the Raspberry Pi through a Cloud to Device (C2D) message and the status will be displayed on the Sense HAT LED display. 

### Obtain Values Required to Connect Function to the IoT Hub

Before you start to build out the Azure function, you'll need some configuration information from the IoT Hub you provisioned. <br>
1. Get the values associated with the Event Hub compatible endpoints as well as the IoT Hub Connection String:
  - Open the Azure Portal [here](https://ms.portal.azure.com)
  - Click on the IoT Hub that was created earlier. 
  - Under the "Settings" category click on “Built-in Endpoints”.
  - In the list of "Built-in endpoints", expand section called “Events”. 
  - Take note of the values for the “Event Hub-compatible name” and “Event Hub-compatible endpoint" fields. 
  - 
  - Feel free to use the [IoTHOL-LabParameters.xlsx](/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/IoTHOL-LabParameters.xlsx) to note these new values. <br />

### Create a Function

In the next part of this lab, you will be creating a C# Azure Function that will get triggered whenever the IoT hub service receives a new event. 
For ease of getting through the lab, we have provided the code that you will need to write the function. When triggered, the code in the function will compare the input to the set threshold (the tag parameter setting that you previously set to a value of 40). If the value is above or below, the function will send a cloud to device (C2D) message to the Device (RaspberryPi or IoTDevKit). Note: To be technically correct, the function actually gets triggered when the event hub compatible endpoint within the IoT Hub service receives an event. IoT Hub service is built with the event hub service running under the covers.
1. Navigate to the Azure portal: https://portal.azure.com 
2. Click the ‘+’ sign and type in “function app” 
    <p align="center">

    </p> 
 3.	Click the “Create” button <br> 
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/CreateFunction2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" />
    </p> 

4.	Fill out the required values to create a function <br>
  - Provide the function app a name (eg. functionC2DHoL)
  - Select your Azure subscription
  - If given an option to choose between "Windows", "Linux" and "Docker" as the OS, choose "Windows" (At the time of this publication, Linux was still in preview)
  - Select your existing subscription that you are using for the hands on lab
  - For hosting plan, select “consumption plan”
  - For location, choose the closest data centre (eg. East US)
  - For storage, select “create new” and provide a name for the storage
  - You can leave Application Insights turned off
  - Click “Create” <br>
      <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/CreateFunction3.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" />
    </p> 
  
5. Once the Function app is created, click the function (the function icon is the one in the shape of a lightning bolt)
6. Click the ‘+’ sign beside the “Functions” node in the hierarchy tree
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/CreateFunction4.jpg" />
    </p> 
7. Click on “Custom Function”
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/CustomFunction.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" />
    </p> 
8. Scroll down and choose the “EventHubTrigger”
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/ChooseEventHub.jpg" width="70%" height="70%" />
    </p> 
9. Choose "C#" as the language and give your new function a name in the “Name your function” field. eg. MessageTriggerFunction<BR>
  New fields should show up on the screen. <br>
  Select the "new" button. 
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/NewFunction1.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" />
    </p> 
10.	Here you will create an “IoT Hub connection”. This step will connect your new Azure function as a consumer of the IoT Hub that you provisioned. The next few steps will walk you through a simple wizard that will allow you to build out the required connection string. 
    - Click the "IoT Hub” tab.
    - Under the *IoT Hub* drop down box, select your IoT Hub eg. Iothandsonlabs
    - Under the *Endpoint* drop down box, select “Events (built-in endpoint)
    - Click “Select”
  
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/IotHubConnection.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" />
    </p>
11.	The “Event Hub connection” field should auto-populate with the Event hub-compatible connection string. In the "Event Hub name" file, enter name that was obtained above. eg. iothandsonlabc4f51. <br>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/CreateEHTrigger.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" />
    </p>
  - Finally, click the “Create” button. The template for your new Event Hub trigger is now created! 
12.	You will now configure the required libraries that will be needed for the new function created. 
  - Expand the “Logs” view at the bottom of the page
  - Click on “View Files”	

![Expand Function views](/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/functionViews.jpg)

  - Click on “+ Add” under the "View files" tab. 
  - Enter “project.json” <br />
![Add project file](/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/addProject.jpg)

  - Copy the text from [project.json](/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/AzureFunction/project.json) file in the github repo to the new json file you created.
  - Click "Save and Run" to restore packages. 
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/images/projectSave.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" />
    </p>    
13.	Now add the main source code that will used within the function
  - Copy the text from [Function.txt](/HOL/IOTHubPiHackathon/AzureFunction/AzureFunction.txt) in the github repo to the "run.csx" file. 
  - In the run.csx file, find the CONNECTION_STRING variable and set the value to the IoT Hub Primary Key Connection String obtained in an earlier lab.
  - Click “Save and run” to run the function

    </p>

## Trying it out

You will now attempt to trigger the function and have the function send a message back to the Sense HAT. 
If you recall in lab 2, you created a tag parameter called tags.HighTemperatureLimit and set it to 40. This is the threshold that will determine when the status of the Sense HAT will change to Hot (if temperature is above the limit) or to Normal (when the temperature drops below the limit). When the status changes, the state (hot or normal) will appear on the Sense HAT display LEDs. 

# Raspberry PI / Sense Hat Setup
1. If your python script is no longer running on the Raspberry Pi, start it back up using the command ```python SenseHat_IoTHub_Http_Lab_Key.py```
2. Try to get the temperature of the Sense HAT above the threshold value (if set to the instructed value, you should be trying to get the temperature above 40C)

If you are having difficulties getting the temperature on your physical Sense HAT over the threshold, you can do one of the following:
- Lower the threshold in the device twin for the RaspberryPi device. You can do this in the solution accelerator portal (see steps in lab 2 to determine how to change the HighTemperatureLimit) 
- Update your Python script to use the Sense Hat emulator instead of the physical board. Using the Sense HAT emulator will allow you to virtually control the temperature (and other properties)

# Lab Cleanup and Rollback

**IMPORTANT** - the next lab walks you through the steps to either delete or scale down the resources that you created for this workshop. If you do not walk through these steps, the services will continue to run in your subscription and therefore cost you money. <BR>
